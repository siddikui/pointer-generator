INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  manchester united manager louis van gaal has asked his players not to play as many __backpasses__ to goalkeeper david de gea as he faces mounting criticism over his side 's __unadventurous__ performances this season . despite travelling to newcastle united on wednesday in a champions league spot , united fans booed their team during saturday 's 2-0 win against sunderland , most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their spanish ` keeper . though van gaal is keen for supporters to lay off his players , he does admit sharing their frustration at de gea being __over-used__ as a springboard for attacks . louis van gaal said he agreed with the fans that sometimes it was frustrating watching manchester united . van gaal felt that sometimes his team passed the ball back to david de gea unnecessarily . ' i agree with the fans that we do n't have to use the goalkeeper so much , ' he said . ' i have seen moments when we could play with a higher tempo without interfering with the goalkeeper . ` sometimes the players may not see another solution . but i have to support them . also , a fan has to see that . ` of course , to attack is more or less the english style of playing a match . but i think the supporters have also enjoyed manchester united playing in a possession game so it is always a mix of playing both . i think we can still improve in not losing the ball unnecessarily . ' united 's run of two defeats in 21 matches has failed to paper over some other cracks . their supporters brought up in the successful sir alex ferguson era chanted ` attack , attack , attack ' in the first half of their victory at old trafford at the weekend . angel di maria was brought off at half time during united 's recent clash with sunderland at old trafford . robin van persie remains out with an ankle injury for manchester united 's trip to newcastle . out : van persie -lrb- ankle -rrb- . probable line-up : de gea ; valencia , smalling , evans , rojo ; januzaj , blind , herrera , di maria ; rooney , falcao . and record signing angel di maria was brought off after half-time with the # 59.7 million argentine looking uncomfortable with van gaal 's desire to win matches through controlling possession . van gaal admits the raft of players he signed in the summer including di maria are struggling to come to terms with english football and said it may take 12 months for united fans to see the best of them . ` the first season is always difficult . you can see it with every player we bought -- shaw , blind , herrera , falcao and also di maria . ` how long it takes depends on so many different aspects of the game , the match and also the culture of the country . you can not give a general answer -- but the general answer is one year ! colombian forward radamel falcao has failed to hit the heights expected of him at united . van gaal also felt that united 's new players needed up to a year to settle in at the club . united 's season rests on the next six weeks when they face tottenham , liverpool , manchester city and chelsea in the league and arsenal in an fa cup semi-final . although it is a daunting schedule , van gaal is taking heart at their run at the end of last year when they rose from 13th to third after a run that included back-to-back away wins at arsenal and southampton followed by a thumping 3-0 win against liverpool . ' robin van persie is ruled out of the game at st james ' park with an ankle injury while michael carrick is only likely to be on the bench having not played since january 23 because of a ruptured muscle . spanish midfielder ander herrera is available despite reports saying he was due in court in spain on thursday as part of an ongoing match-fixing investigation . the case , which involves 42 different football figures , has been put back until the summer .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  the missing philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from earth could wake up from today . scientists at the european space agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko . they lost contact with the __washing-machine__ sized spacecraft in november last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff . starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments , the lander 's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface . esa scientists have renewed efforts to contact the philae lander on comet 67p , shown in the illustration above . however , as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system , researchers hope philae will get enough light to come back to life . the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p . it chased comet __67p/churyumov__ -- __gerasimenko__ through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014 . after a four billion mile -lrb- 6.5 billion km -rrb- journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre -lrb- 40 inches -rrb- per second relative to the comet . but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet . this resulted in it bouncing to a height of __0.62__ miles -lrb- 1km -rrb- above the comet before again landing on the surface . it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude . scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet . the european space agency has now turned on the communication unit on the rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet . stephen __ulamec__ , lander project manager at the german aerospace centre -lrb- __dlr__ -rrb- , said : ` philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in november last year . ` it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying . the prospects will improve with each passing day . ' comet 67p is now 186 million miles -lrb- 300 million km -rrb- from the sun . scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun , philae 's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under . philae touched down on 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice . it first bounced to a height of __0.62__ miles -lrb- 1km -rrb- and then 65ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground . blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air . scientists described the comet 's surface as being more like a trampoline , causing the probe to rebound so far . it is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site . the rosetta orbiter took a number of images of philae as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right . however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . the __duck-shaped__ comet __67p/churyumove-geraismenko__ is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . this image sent back by the philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the __mothership__ rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe . philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an __overhanging__ cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander . before its batteries finally ran out , philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images . among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet 's surface appears to be made of a very hard ` __sintered__ ' ice . this graphic shows how philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life . from several miles above the comet , rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived . but there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels . this would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board . the image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the __philea__ lander . comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander . philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least __-45__ degrees c before it can wake up . it will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up . once awake , philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the rosetta orbiter . __koen__ __guerts__ , part of the philae lander team at the __dlr__ control centre , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home . he said : ` philae is designed so that , since november 2014 , it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up . ' ` at this time , we do not yet know that the lander is __awake.to__ send us an answer , philae must also turn its transmitter -- and that requires additional power . ' this blurry image captures the moment philae bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself . rosetta captured a __mothership__ 's view of philae as it descended to the surface of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication . over the next eight days the rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 __flybys__ . engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to __optimise__ the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with earth . once philae wakes up and can also transmit , it will first send data about its ` health ' to earth . the scientific work with the 10 instruments on board philae also depends on these results . if sufficient energy can not be stored in the battery , the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed . currently , scientists believe that philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys . mr __ulamec__ added : ` once we can communicate with philae again , the scientific work can begin . '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: european space agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe . philae has been missing since november when it landed on comet 67p . scientists believe the lander bounced into a ditch in the shade of a cliff . but they say it may already be awake but not yet able to send messages . the probe needs 19 watts of power from its solar panels to communicate . as the comet gets closer to the sun the lander may receive more sunlight . scientists have sent commands to philae for it to begin warming itself up . they will attempt to contact the lander with rosetta over the next 8 days .

with caretaker managers , interim appointments , and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time , it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers . counting caretaker managers would mean , technically , that david __pleat__ had been appointed tottenham manager three times in five years . there were times when it seemed david __pleat__ just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at spurs again . ruud gullit had already left two premier league clubs before wenger had been in the job three years . gordon strachan -lrb- left -rrb- replacing ron atkinson was the second change after wenger arrived . so while ` interim ' managers are included in our total , caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term . added to that , for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time , they are counted as only one sacking unless , as with the case of roy evans when he worked alongside gerard __houlier__ at liverpool , one is sacked before the other . landmarks . that all means that gus poyet 's sacking this month is the __156th__ managerial change since wenger took over . ray __harford__ 's resignation at blackburn , less than a month after ` the professor ' got his feet under the desk at arsenal , was the first , with five more coming in the __1996-97__ season . ray __harford__ -lrb- left -rrb- was the first manager to go after wenger was appointed , while gus poyet is the most recent . peter reid 's dismissal from leeds united in november 2003 marked the 50th reign wenger had survived , while steve bruce 's decision to leave wigan for sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009 . tony pulis ' shock resignation from crystal palace on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the wenger era . peter reid , sacked by leeds in 2003 , marked the 50th premier league manager to go in the wenger era . when steve bruce left wigan for sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since wenger arrived . unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years . the first half of wenger 's tenure at arsenal produced just 63 __sackings__ in a little over nine years . in the same time since then , there have been 93 changes , at a rate of around 10 a season . last season 's total of 14 managerial changes was , in fact , the largest number in premier league history . in contrast the __2002-03__ season saw the fewest changes since wenger 's arrival , with only five managers leaving their posts . tony pulis ' resignation from crystal palace last summer was change no 150 since wenger started . method of change ? the vast majority of the time , when a premier league manager leaves his job , it 's because he 's been told to clear out his desk . a lucky few get to set their own date , as wenger surely will in the coming years , but most are pushed before they can jump . remarkably , in the last __18-and-a-bit__ years since wenger joined arsenal , only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job -lrb- and three of those went to international management rather than another club -rrb- , while some resigned and a handful retired . roy hodgson is one of only two premier league managers in the past two decades to leave for england . steve mcclaren also left a premier league club to take the biggest job in english football . three times a manager stepped down for health reasons , although two of those were joe kinnear , while one manager , dave jones , was placed on gardening leave in january 2000 . ron atkinson -lrb- coventry -rrb- and steve __coppell__ -lrb- crystal palace -rrb- share the honour of being the two managers in since 1996 to have been removed from their job only to move upwards to director of football , something that may well happen to wenger when he decides to end his term in management . which clubs change the most ? we all have a good idea who we consider to be the most __trigger-happy__ owners , or the least stable clubs , and it should therefore come as no surprise which two clubs top the list of managerial changes . chelsea and newcastle united have each replaced 11 men since arsene wenger walked into highbury . at stamford bridge there were only two __sackings__ -- ruud gullit and gianluca __vialli__ -- between the arrivals of wenger and roman abramovich , but the revolving door has turned nine times since the russian arrived . glenn hoddle -lrb- left -rrb- and alan shearer have both managed one of the league 's most prolific clubs . jose mourinho 's return for his second spell at chelsea was the club 's 12th appointment since wenger started . since roman abramovich took over at chelsea the club have had nine managers , jose twice , in 12 years . manchester united - 2 . everton - 4 . liverpool - 6 . aston villa - 7 . tottenham - 10 . chelsea - 11 . change has at least brought success for chelsea , but the same can not be said at st james ' park , where john carver is the 12th man to try and pick up a trophy since arsenal last appointed a manager . the gunners ' north london rivals tottenham are just behind chelsea and newcastle , having replaced 10 managers since their neighbours went for wenger . gerry francis , jacques __santini__ , christian gross , george graham , glenn hoddle , martin jol , __juande__ ramos , harry redknapp , andre villas-boas and tim sherwood have all left since wenger arrived . jacques __santini__ -lrb- left -rrb- and martin jol are two of the 10 tottenham managers who have been replaced . tim sherwood -lrb- right -rrb- became the 10th spurs manager to do battle with wenger last season . perhaps most impressive in their high number of changes though , are southampton and sunderland , who have managed nine premier league managerial replacements each , despite spending a fair amount of time outside the top flight since 1996 . saints have had seven wenger years below the premier league -- including two in __legue__ one -- while sunderland have had five . of the top flight 's __ever-presents__ , manchester united have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes , with just sir alex ferguson 's retirement and david moyes ' sacking , while liverpool have said goodbye to six bosses during wenger 's tenure . sir alex ferguson -lrb- right -rrb- and wenger locked horns repeatedly until the former 's retirement in 2013 . who has managed the most clubs ? it is not just clubs that can get restless . while wenger has been happy to stick in one job since deep blue something 's breakfast at tiffany 's was top of the charts , other managers prefer to move around . england manager roy hodgson has left four premier league clubs -- blackburn , fulham , liverpool and west brom -- in the last 18 years . harry redknapp has left five premier league jobs in the time wenger has been in his only one . redknapp won the fa cup in one of his two spells at portsmouth , which ended in october 2008 . stoke city boss mark hughes is on his fifth premier league job since wenger arrived in north london . stoke city 's mark hughes has matched that , his terms at blackburn , fulham , manchester city and qpr all coming to an end while wenger stayed put . but neither of them can match harry redknapp , who has left five jobs , at four clubs , since the arsenal boss took charge of his side . redknapp most recently resigned as qpr manager , but has also been in charge at tottenham , west ham and had two spells at portsmouth in the top flight .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  cristiano ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped lionel messi as the ballon d'or winner for 2013 . he was also officially crowned the world 's best player , above messi , for 2014 . but here 's the bad news , cristiano . despite the gongs and the __widely-held__ opinion that ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years , messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014 . that is the view of the __number-crunchers__ at the economist , who have calculated the worth of each player 's goals , based on how crucial the goal was to the match result -lrb- and the subsequent gains from that result -rrb- , as well as the importance of the game . lionel messi -lrb- left -rrb- and cristiano ronaldo -lrb- right -rrb- in action during last sunday 's el clasico duel . messi 's barcelona beat ronaldo 's real madrid 2-1 at the nou camp , with the portuguese scoring . the explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated , so to read them in full click here . sportsmail 's calculator also seems to be broken , so again to see the full numbers , let the economists 's __boffins__ guide you through . be warned , though : the introduction contains a reference to ` the __pythagorean__ formula extended for soccer ' , so it 's not for the faint-hearted . but the key facts are these . messi 's -lrb- still fantastic -rrb- total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with ronaldo 's superhuman 105 . ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the ballon d'or over messi in 2013 . the real madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the champions league final last season . but ronaldo 's penalty against atletico madrid was virtually worthless , according to the economist . each of ronaldo 's 105 goals , however , were worth an average of __0.40__ points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored . by contrast , messi 's 86 goals were worth an average of __0.47__ points each . and if that sounds like __gobbledegook__ , essentially this can be explained in simple terms : a goal in a match where the score is tied 1-1 in the final minutes yields more points -lrb- or aggregate value in cup ties -rrb- to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player 's team is already winning 3-1 . the economist uses ronaldo 's three goals in the semi-final and final of last year 's champions league as an example to show their relative lack of value . in the second leg of the semi-final against bayern munich , ronaldo scored when real led 3-0 and 4-0 on aggregate . and in the final against atletico madrid , his penalty in extra-time when madrid were 3-1 ahead had a virtually negligible value . messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to ronaldo since 2013 . messi is on international duty with argentina and is pictured here training in washington . messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but ronaldo walked off with the prize . the importance of messi 's goals means he should have claimed the big prize six times , says the economist . messi , however , scored a winning goal in the final 20 minutes of a match on five different occasions in 2013 and 2014 , which hands him the advantage over ronaldo . the economist suggests that the only reason that the argentina star has not claimed six ballon __d'ors__ in a row is ` messi fatigue ' . if you 've got a spare week or so , a working __abacus__ and carol vorderman available for a chat , you could try to prove them wrong ...
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: cristiano ronaldo has won the last two world player of the year awards . lionel messi had won previous four but ronaldo beat his long-time rival . real madrid superstar is widely acknowledged to have deserved gongs . but the economist argues that messi is still the superior player . read : ronaldo or messi ? rio ferdinand wades in on the debate .

' hummels , looking ahead to what would normally be a __title-deciding__ clash with bayern , said : ` we want to beat bayern . at the moment we 're in __no-man__ 's land but we could still slip back . if we beat bayern , then we 'll see . ' star man marco reus has signed a contract extension but could still move to barcelona in 2016 . ilkay gundogan -lrb- right -rrb- has yet to commit to a new dortmund contract and could leave in the summer . after an upturn in form , dortmund find themselves just five points off a europa league place . manager jurgen klopp -lrb- second right -rrb- with sebastian __kehl__ and jakub __blaszczykowski__ after saturday 's win . whether europe is realistic or not - they are five points off the europa league places with eight games to play - dortmund are in a much better place than a couple of months ago . no-one truly believed they could go down , yet at times they seemed intent on testing the proposition to the full . but reus signing a new four-year contract was an enormous boost , all the more so as it contained no release clause . it may well be that reus joins barcelona in the summer of 2016 , the catalan club where his friend marc-andre ter stegen already plays understood to be his preferred destination . even so , reus should be at the __westfalenstadion__ next season . hummels may not be . louis van gaal attempted to bring him back to bayern munich when coach there ; he will undoubtedly try to do the same again this summer , though he will have to meet the # 35m asking price . interestingly , sources at dortmund are already putting it about that # 35m would make up for the shortfall of missing out in the champions league , which sounds like a pre-sale process of softening up the fans . the lowest point in dortmund 's season came when players like hummels had to front up to the fans . but an upturn in fortunes has lifted them out of relegation danger - pierre-emerick aubameyang -lrb- left -rrb- and marco reus here wear masks to celebrate a goal in the 3-0 defeat of rivals schalke . the dortmund player salute their travelling support after last weekend 's 3-2 win at hannover . the key question remains about the man who has come to __personify__ dortmund , klopp . like sir alex ferguson at manchester united and arsene wenger at arsenal , klopp 's personality , tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club . understandably klopp is always considered when top jobs come up . he was on the shortlist to replace roberto mancini at manchester city but did not impress in interview - the passion that drives his teams sits uncomfortably with the increasingly corporate world of football executives . it looks as though those pushing for him as a natural replacement for arsene wenger at arsenal __overplayed__ their hand somewhat . the intensity of the rivalry with bayern munich means he is highly unlikely to end up there when pep guardiola ends his time in 2016 . striker pierre-emerick aubameyang poses for a photo with dortmund fans after saturday 's win . former manchester united man shinji kagawa celebrates with reus after scoring at hannover . and there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied __counter-attacking__ style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked europe 's best sides . for now it looks as if klopp and dortmund 's fates are bound together . at times , the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of klopp 's own volatile personality . yet it 's not so long ago he was a genuine __wunderkind__ of european football . if he can emerge refreshed and __re-energised__ from this season 's chaos , there seems no reason why dortmund should n't rise again in europe . the next few weeks should tell us much . if dortmund do make the europa league , then you might conclude that the rebuilding process is already underway .

' i won the championship again last year , and i felt like it was n't a fluke . i 'm deserving of where i am . ` and i worked damn hard to get that win in australia . again there was n't any luck involved .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  an aspiring foreign manager emboldened by radical ideas meets a settled , __ego-fuelled__ dressing room that 's enjoyed no little success . sound familiar ? for peter lawwell , the warning signs upon appointing ronny deila to the celtic manager 's post last summer were to be found not a million miles from home . when paul le __guen__ arrived at rangers in the summer of 2006 , there seemed solid grounds for fans of the ibrox club not to question if the frenchman would be a runaway success , but to just what extent . celtic manager ronny deila -lrb- left -rrb- and chief executive peter lawwell launch new kit deal at celtic park . lawwell has dismissed comparison between deila and former rangers boss paul le __guen__ -lrb- right -rrb- . after a difficult start , deila has started to turn things around at parkhead . this was , after all , not only a coach who had brought three successive titles to the ligue 1 club lyon , but one who had made them a name to be feared across europe . if le __guen__ could drop just a little of his je ne __sais__ __quoi__ into the ibrox water , the sky would be the limit . so went the theory , anyway . yet , by january 4 the following year , the frenchman was already history -- his departure a cautionary tale of too much , too soon , resistance to change and the importance of __unstinting__ backing from the boardroom . disastrous though le __guen__ 's short tenure was , to this day it 's only natural for the rump of the rangers support to wonder what might have transpired had he been afforded more time . fast-forward eight years to the start of this season and -- on the other half of the city -- parallels with the frenchman were being drawn . whilst stromsgodset were much further down the football __food-chain__ than lyon , deila still arrived with the pedigree of being a league winner as a manager . and , just as le __guen__ had faced resistance from a squad used to alex mcleish 's methods for so long , much of the norwegian 's methodology was bound to grate with a squad that had thrived under neil lennon . when domestic reverses began to __intertwine__ with european __capitulations__ , there seemed a danger that history might repeat itself . lyon 's former league winning manager le __guen__ arrived at ibrox with a big reputation in 2006 . the frenchman left rangers the following january after losing games and the dressing room . ` when we set off with him , we knew we were going to give him time , ' lawwell insisted . ` if you go back to le __guen__ -- i always say to ronny about the `` le __guen__ hump '' . ` when he came in , he 'd won __three-in-a-row__ in france , had new ideas , a new philosophy and a new culture . ` it did n't work . it was revolution rather than evolution . bang . the players __revolted__ and he went out . ` so we had to get over that le __guen__ hump if you like and manage through that . ` you get the players on board and get everything settled down . he 's done that brilliantly . ' notwithstanding wednesday 's home defeat to st johnstone , there is no disputing the fact that both the manager and his players are now in a much brighter place . earlier this week , john hartson eloquently described how he now looks at celtic ' s early struggles under the norwegian as almost being in a different season and few who witnessed them will find that difficult to relate to . but , asked if -- in the dark moments of autumn -- he privately harboured doubts about the man he championed , lawwell was unambiguous . the norwegian manager looks on during celtic 's 1-0 defeat to st johnstone on wednesday . despite the defeat , the hoops are six points clear at the top of the scottish premiership table . ` we 're paid for these judgment calls and there was never any question of knee-jerk reactions to a bad result , or a bad couple of results , ' he insisted . ` genuinely , when ronny came in , we understood where he was strong and where he was weak ; he was weak in terms of experience . ` nothing prepares you for celtic , as a manager or even a player coming here . we knew there would be a transitional period . we knew it would be a baptism of fire . the champions league was right on us . there was a risk . ` but when we appointed him , we assessed that risk , and felt for the long-term good of the club it was the right thing to do . ronny is a creator . he will create a team , he will create players . ` we ca n't afford or can get into the market for champions league players so we need someone who creates champions league players , and that is what he does . he is a developer of players and that takes time . ` he is a highly intelligent guy ; he is a progressive coach and , through time , it will prove that we were right . we feel we are making progress ; we have won nothing , yet . but hopefully in the short and longer term , he will create a fantastic team for celtic . ' the first opportunity for a tangible sign of that progress comes in the form of the league cup final with dundee united at hampden on sunday week . in terms of a turning point for a season that at one point threatened to __implode__ , lawwell feels the injury-time win with 10 men at __pittodrie__ in early november -- followed by the ronny roar at its most ferocious -- was it . deila trains with his players , with lawwell insisting the former stromsgodset boss ` creates ' a team . deila shares a laugh with manchester city loanee john __guidetta__ -lrb- left -rrb- during a training session . ` i think that was a change , yes , ' lawwell reflected . ` no question . that helped change the fans ' perception of him in terms of his emotion that day . ' ultimately , deila 's appointment was sanctioned by the board but it was the chief executive who first put his neck on the line for him . ` my job is to recommend , and the board and dermot -lrb- desmond -rrb- backed that , ' he explained . ` it is the same with any manager . ` you get paid to make judgment calls . some are right , some are wrong . this was the big one . it is the normal pressure for the job i am in . ` we have a strong relationship . i have been here long enough . i have supported celtic all my life . i know the west of scotland , i know glasgow and , hopefully , i know a bit about scottish football . ` so i think that was a help to him . no matter who it is , nothing prepares you for the intensity of this job . you guys -lrb- in the media -rrb- know the intensity of it , the scrutiny of it . he is a young guy , but he is a quick learner . with a tail wind and a bit of luck , he can be a great manager . ` his personality is beginning to come out . he is a leader . he has all the attributes and qualities to be a great manager . all you need is a bit of luck and be in the right time and the right place . ' deila will get his first chance for silverware when celtic face dundee united in the league cup final . lawwell has given deila 8/10 for results and __10/10__ for showing progress in his debut season . the destination of the season 's major prizes may yet be unknown but lawwell __isn__ ' t of a mind to hide deila 's light under a __bushel__ . asked to rate his success to date in terms of a mark out of 10 , lawwell replied : ` in terms of results , eight . in term of coming in and __acclimatising__ and showing progress , 10 . ` he has become more relaxed , more confident . results bring that . he is fitting in to the environment here and outside , which again is a big change for him . the players are buying into him . the players are with him , you can see that with the team . that is giving him the confidence to push on .

' at the moment , transactions like this between laura and her northern irish clients are legal . however , from june 1 , a new law will mean that men who pay laura for sex could be arrested . the legislation is being championed by democratic unionist peer lord morrow . it will make northern ireland the first region in the uk to ban payment for sex between consenting adults . laura says she is a dominatrix providing a ` girlfriend experience ' the so-called ` swedish model ' -- which makes it illegal to buy sex , but not to sell it -- has been heavily criticised by groups including the world health organisation and amnesty international . they say there 's no evidence it works and that , instead , it causes real harm to women . police in northern ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister , david ford , has said to will be hard to enforce . importantly , a department of justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law . ` even women who 've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what 's needed is refuge and rehab not the __criminalisation__ of clients , ' laura said . the law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking , although the department of justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it . last year , there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in northern ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers . laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . the main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . ` lord morrow has effectively said that he really could n't care less about the welfare of sex workers , ' she said . once the law comes in , the __crusading__ dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to northern ireland 's high court and finally to the european court of human rights . the team will challenge the legislation on several articles . they are hoping to prove that lord morrow 's law __contravenes__ the european convention on human rights , including the rights to privacy , health and protection from degrading treatment . the law may even flout the human right to life . if prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous , laura has no doubt that deaths will follow . ` sex workers are going to suffer , ' she said . ' i witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when i was working in dublin . as soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit , violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it was n't too long before -lsb- 21-year-old sex worker -rsb- sinead kelly was stabbed to death by a client . ' last year , a similar law was proposed in the uk by mp fiona __mactaggart__ . but after a campaign by the english collective of prostitutes -lrb- __ecp__ -rrb- , the sex worker open university and the women 's institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote . laura watson of the __ecp__ said they are behind laura lee 's fight in northern ireland . ` internationally , sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger , ' she said . ` legal challenges , spearheaded by sex workers , are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other __1,097__ matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and manchester united , you know it was something special . forever known as wembley 's ` five-minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2-0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3-2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore . it created a superstar in arsenal 's man-of-the-match liam brady and broke the career of manchester united manager dave sexton . pat jennings -lrb- left -rrb- and pat rice pose with the fa cup after the dramatic wembley final of 1979 . jennings reacts after conceding a goal as manchester united fought back to level the scores at 2-2 . but alan sunderland scored the winning goal for arsenal to write his name into cup folklore . victorious captain pat rice was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy , he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour . rice recalls : ` prince charles was there to present the trophy . he said , ` congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans . ' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal . it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand . it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that . eager is the polite way of putting it . just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ` f *** , we 've blown it ' . ' sammy mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time . ` it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds __ruefully__ . ` they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against liverpool two years earlier . ' united and arsenal meet again in the fa cup on monday in a quarter-final at old trafford but it is impossible that wayne rooney and alexis sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did . ` there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says brady , who helped set up the winning goal when arsenal were on their knees reeling from mcilroy 's equaliser . ' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23-year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland . sammy mcilroy -lrb- left -rrb- scored united 's equaliser against arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final . alexis sanchez -lrb- left -rrb- of arsenal and wayne rooney -lrb- right -rrb- of manchester united will lock horns on monday . the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after margaret thatcher had been elected great britain 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the fa cup final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time . a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed . united travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with bbc and itv planning their entire saturday schedules around the final . then , as now , arsenal and united were big clubs in transition . arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of george best , denis law and bobby charlton . they had been relegated to the second division five years earlier . both sets of supporters flocked down wembley way convinced good times were about to return for their club . for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a __43rd-minute__ header . the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal -- talbot or sunderland , who appeared to connect at the same time . ' i know it was mine . i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan kicking my boot , ' says talbot . with arsenal leading 2-0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in . ` it was unprofessional but i met eyes with liam as if to say , ` yes , we 've won it ' , ' says graham __rix__ . ` we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds talbot . even the experienced jennings says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps . ' brian talbot -lrb- right -rrb- opened the scoring for arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against united . gordon mcqueen -lrb- fifth left -rrb- pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give united hope . then , with just five minutes left , arsenal boss terry neill decided to send on substitute steve walford for david price as a thank-you for his performances in earlier rounds . it backfired disastrously . out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , gordon mcqueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2-1 . just 106 second later , mcilroy __jinked__ past david o'leary and walford before __toepoking__ past an onrushing jennings to equalise . pandemonium ensued in the stadium as arsenal fell apart . ' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says neill . ` in reality , my insides were going up and down . ' reflecting now , mcilroy says : ` the arsenal boys were gone , on their knees . if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won . ' i went crazy , i could have run out of wembley and back in again after that goal . after the game , bob bishop -lsb- the scout from northern ireland who discovered both mcilroy and best -rsb- told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated . ` he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away . ' at 2-2 , united were now red-hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of fa cup legend . brady surged into the united half past mickey thomas , then past lou __macari__ , and slipped a ball to __rix__ on the left . frank stapleton in possession for arsenal in the cup final against united at wembley in 1979 . liam brady -lrb- left -rrb- , frank stapleton -lrb- centre -rrb- and david o'leary -lrb- right -rrb- were in arsenal 's winning squad . __rix__ , a 21-year-old from a south yorkshire pit village , delivered a cross that __arced__ away from united goalkeeper gary bailey , leaving sunderland the chance to score from close-range . the picture of the __bouffant-haired__ forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the __most-relieved__ substitute in history , walford , remains an iconic image . ` when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says brady . ' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw graham outside me . ' __rix__ takes up the story . ' i did n't know sunderland was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper . it was something i 'd trained on with -lsb- coach -rsb- don howe all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp . ' sunderland says : ' i went into __auto-pilot__ and when the ball went it , the pent-up emotion came out . ' just two minutes , 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made . more than 250,000 arsenal fans greeted the team 's heroes in islington the following day . the arsenal players collected bonuses nearly three times their # __1,000-a-week__ wages but for some the long-term rewards turned out to be far greater . brady 's performances against juventus in the following season 's european __cup-winners__ ' cup persuaded the italian giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other first division stars like ray wilkins and paul gascoigne to go to serie a. for united , being a runner-up was not good enough and sexton was sacked within two years . ` he was unlucky , if we 'd won the final , he would have been given more time , ' says thomas , a comment that will be of interest to louis van gaal . more than 250,000 supporters came out to greet arsenal the day after their fa cup triumph . arsenal parade the trophy around wembley after securing a dramatic victory over united . arsenal 's class of __'79__ still meet up for reunions at the emirates and rice will be at old trafford tomorrow with the club 's board of directors . ' i still remember the elation , ' says the former arsenal captain . ` when __sundy__ scored , i thought , ` right , we 're not going to bloody lose this again ' .

undone by familiar defensive failings that leave them in danger of being cut adrift . defender rio ferdinand was singled out for particular criticism from disgruntled home supporters , but it was a collective failure at the back that __undid__ ramsey 's team . ` we need to go away and regroup , ' the qpr head coach said . rangers had started the match well . striker bobby zamora forced a flying

ball , __nedum__ onuoha ducked under it and kane beat green to the ball to head it past the onrushing keeper and into the empty net . luck ran against the home team before the interval when mauricio isla ran on to a clever through ball from steven caulker and appeared to be brought down by lloris . to bitter protests from qpr , referee pawson waved play on . kane showed in stoppage time at the end of the half what a fine all-round player he is becoming with a fine pass out to townsend . townsend 's shot took an awkward deflection and green scrambled to his right to push it out . and spurs began the second half in the same vein when a ferocious , whipped shot from eriksen beat the despairing dive of green only to rebound off the inside of a post . spurs keeper hugo lloris is left __standed__ as qpr 's mauricio isla has an attempt on goal . qpr striker austin beats jan vertonghen to the ball and gets his shot away on goal . sandro looks to win the ball while surrounded by spurs duo ryan mason and andros townsend . both chris ramsey and mauricio pochettino do their best to get their message across to their players . qpr were desperately trying to stay in touch now and it took some desperate defending to stop spurs extending their lead . kane showed great vision again to play in walker on the right and when green smothered his attempted cross , eriksen followed up with a crisp volley that was blocked on the line by austin . qpr could n't hold spurs at bay any longer , though , and midway through the half , kane put the match out of their reach . he beat the offside trap and ran on to a ball from ryan mason , whose energy and ability will also have caught hodgson 's eye , before taking the ball round green and sliding it into an empty net . that goal sparked a frantic qpr fightback . fifteen minutes from the end , austin , who had worked himself into the ground , crossed for zamora . he laid the ball back into the path of the brazilian , sandro , whose neat

' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt .

' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , __leolah__ brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong __evidene__ of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do !

' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her __bath-tub__ just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs . '' gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta . meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma . it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina -- __krissi__ as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia . unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation . while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with nick , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged . in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ . sounding eerily similar to bobbi 's mother and father 's __drug-dependent__ relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on . ` bobbi and nick would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had . it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs . ` there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed . there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice . she was always covered in cigarette burns . ' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person 's life . but more and more frustrated australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday , a new study has found . a survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine kayak found that one in four aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip . travel agents ' interests , the overload of information online , hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making __holiday-bookers__ extra cautious with their plans . about 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip . one in four aussies , like sydney marketing manager sam kelly -lrb- pictured on his last trip to bali -rrb- , spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . sydney marketing manager sam kelly , admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours . ' i spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it 's a big process . i do n't go on budget holidays , but i 've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process , ' he told daily mail australia . the 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews , adding that despite enjoying the process , he found it took up a ` ridiculous amount of time ' . ` it 's the amount of information out there . one website that will do that __legwork__ for you and get you the best hotel prices , show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth - would be ideal , ' he said . mr kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred , and he 's not alone . according to kayak 26 per cent of those surveyed from canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average . it also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration . investment banker todd __fortescue__ came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to canada earlier this year . the 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . instead , the couple ditched their travel agent , choosing to find their own booking deals online . ` we were getting frustrated that we were n't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted , ' mr __fortescue__ told daily mail australia . ` we went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they did n't have accommodation in certain areas . it seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves , we found plenty of options . ` there was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates . it was much cheaper when we did it ourselves .

' a recent __meta-analysis__ published by the british homeopathic association has provided independently verified evidence that individually prescribed homeopathic medicines may have clinical effects that are greater than those of __placebos__ . ` the __nhmrc__ 's statement also fails to note that its review commended further quality research in homeopathy .

' i had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky . ' i __itched__ constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too . it was just permanently painful . ' miss james , who works for a recovery firm in northampton , first suffered from a small flare up aged three . she said : ' i ca n't remember not having eczema . it started in the creases of my arms when i was little . ' the eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees , followed by her hands , stomach and over her legs . in her teens , the eczema progressed and by aged 15 , it had spread to her neck and her face . she said : ' i was teased for having ` __lovebites__ ' on my neck but it was the eczema . ' i used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought i was covering the __lovebites__ .

' despite trying countless treatments , nothing worked . skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the british skin foundation . the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults . eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . the skin barrier is unable to function properly , which leads to water loss from the skin , triggering itching . bacteria readily gain entry to the skin - especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection . __moisturisers__ or __emollients__ are the first line in treatment and contain __humectants__ . these contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to __rehydrate__ the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs . the inflammation is treated by topical steroids . oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema . oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally __moisturise__ the skin and relieve itching . they also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect . ` i 'd used light treatment , different creams , medication , herbal remedies - i 'd tried everything , ' she said . and in desperation to keep her condition at bay , she became reliant on steroid cream , which if used incorrectly , can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections . miss james said : ` if i had a flare up , i would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks . ` but when it came back it would be worse than ever . ' eventually , miss james came across the international topical steroid awareness network -lrb- __itsan__ -rrb- which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema . ' after discussing with her doctor , miss james stopped using the treatment in may 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema . but one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats . she said : ` now i make a face mask using goat 's milk and porridge oats , it 's really soothing . ' i have __oat__ baths , you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside . ` the water looks disgusting but it works for me . ' her home treatment , along with __anti-histamines__ from her gp , have cleared up her eczema on some of her body . she said : ` my face is much better now , and my stomach and legs you ca n't even tell i 've got it . ' however she still has severe eczema on her hands , neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery . despite porridge having helped her , she still wears cotton whenever she can . miss james also credits her the support of her partner of six years , nicola wilson , 26 , with her progress . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy ' she said : ` nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me . ' i ca n't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me . ` we joke that she 's become my carer . ' however , due to the stress her body is under , and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head , for the past nine months miss james ' hair and eyebrows have been falling out . she now washes her hair just once a week -- with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth -- so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss . she said : ' i have to be careful with my hair as it 's holding on by a thread . i think others in my condition would have shaved their heads . ` it upsets me as i got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out . i __back-comb__ it to cover up bald patches . i 'm trying to make the best of it . ' she added : ' i started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive . ` i 'm no longer just the girl with the eczema .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  now it 's not often that i can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend . but a few weeks ago i was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing -- apparently , the must-have fabric this season , as we experience a seventies revival . as someone who remembers the seventies all too clearly , and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round , i was interested to see how i felt about it now . i did n't know i was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided britain 's women , who , it seems , all have an opinion on that skirt , as it is now known . scroll down for video . jane asher -lrb- pictured -rrb- was recently invited to a photoshoot to give her verdict on a new range of suede clothing , what she did n't realise was that the skirt she is pictured wearing would cause such a sensation . for the few who have n't heard , i 'm talking about the marks & spencer __a-line__ suede skirt , which has been labelled : ` the skirt that will save m&s . ' yet when i spotted it a few weeks ago , it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail , so i had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way . and ... i did n't much like it . i found the suede stiff and heavy , and the colour and shape channelled the seventies __cowgirl__ look a little too closely for comfort . some fashions are best left __unrevisited__ and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them . soon after that , all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt . it was photographed on the __lithe__ and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me -- first alexa chung , then socialite olivia palermo at new york fashion week , both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it . vogue heralded it ` pure ali __macgraw__ chic ' in reference to the star of the seventies film love story , and suddenly it was the next big thing . alexa chung -lrb- pictured -rrb- was spotted in the m&s skirt in february this year . well , i can be as easily influenced as anyone , and a horrible guilt crept over me that i had n't spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had . i wondered : should i rush out and grab one from m&s ? well , not much point , as it wo n't be on sale to us ordinary punters until april 10 . so , should i trust my first feeling that it was n't for me ? after a bit of thought , i came full circle back to my original decision : i 'm still not a fan . yesterday , daily mail columnist sarah vine was one of the first to shout ` emperor 's new clothes ! ' when she criticised m&s for its aggressive marketing of the skirt , which , she felt -- correctly in my view -- seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that does n't follow any trend . ` just because a couple of __voguettes__ have given it their stamp of approval , we loyal m&s customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one , too , ' she said . ` ca n't m&s see how patronising this is ? ' for this suede skirt did n't work in the seventies and it does n't really work now . when i was young , most suede skirts and jackets were stiff , unyielding garments produced in a __gingery__ tan colour that did n't flatter anyone -- especially those of us with __gingery__ , __tan-coloured__ hair -- and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard . sadly , this reincarnation gave me flashbacks . the __unsuppleness__ and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages , but you 'll know about it while you 're wearing it : the waistband is far from forgiving and i ca n't imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down , making it stick out __unattractively__ in front . i 'm not crazy about the __mid-calf__ length , either . unless you have the endless legs of a model , it 's hard to carry off . it would look better with boots , of course , but with spring already here i 'm hoping those can be left in the wardrobe . and i ca n't see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering . sorry , m&s , i 'm giving it just three out of five : wearable for a few outings , after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe , never to be worn again . a costly foray into a brief trend -- something that , at my age , i have mostly learned to avoid . updated classic . jane -lrb- pictured -rrb- loved this flattering suede dress from h&m , finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting , without the stiffness of some other suede garments . wraparound suede dress , # __199.99__ , __hm.com__ . suede __block-heeled__ sandals , # 129 , __ reiss.com__ . __bangle__ , # 39 , __reiss.com__ . button diamond ring , # 210 , __monicavinader.com__ . my favourite : it 's an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour , which suits most skin tones . the suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well . it certainly does n't have the stiffness that some other suede garments have , and the __just-above-the-knee__ length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress . who would have thought i 'd want to be back in a wrap dress again ? i thought we were over those for some time . the fabric updates this classic look . i love it -- especially the great price . 5/5 . should you fake it ? the suede __culottes__ jane is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 . tweed top , # 129 , __baukjen.com__ . __suedette__ __culottes__ , # 24.99 , __hm.com__ . heels , # 225 , __russellandbromley.co.uk__ . no ! no ! no ! __culottes__ tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they 're made in a fluid fabric . these certainly do n't suit me , and i 'm proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt . they cut off my legs at the least flattering part , the calves , and look more __dickensian__ __urchin__ than fashion-forward fabulous . the faux fabric does feel like the real thing , but i suspect that it might crease . if i wanted some suede trousers i 'd save up for a better design . 2/5 . comfy and chic . jane -lrb- pictured -rrb- says this suede top may be worth the # 249 you 'd have to shell out to buy it . she found the item ` extremely chic and wearable ' , saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt . suede top , # 249 , __baukjen.com__ . j. brand jeans , # 180 , __trilogystores.co.uk__ . heels , # 5 , __everything5pounds.com__ . __jewelled__ necklace , # 85 , __stelladot.co.uk__ . deceptively simple , this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it 's extremely chic and wearable , whether teamed with tight brand jeans or a smart skirt . i love the boxy on-trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion , as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections . this suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk , and i like the tunic slit at the top . 4/5 . make a splash . another top scorer was this lilac suede dress . jane -lrb- pictured -rrb- says it fits beautifully , skimming __fluidly__ over the body , with the colour adding to the classy look . suede dress , # __429__ , __baukjen.com__ . blue necklace , # 50 , __stelladot.co.uk__ . suede strappy sandals , # 250 , __lkbennett.com__ . this fits so beautifully and __skims__ __fluidly__ over the body . yes , it costs a lot , but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy . the suede has an almost silky feel . i adored wearing this , but the danger of ruining it with __smudges__ would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash . remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather , tending to show rain spots and stains easily , and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use . it may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray , and they will also need expert cleaning . 4/5 .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by my kitchen rules chef pete evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth . the cookbook , bubba yum yum : the paleo way , has been slammed by the public health association of australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development . one recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of evans ' signature paleo creations . scroll down for video . bubba yum yum : the paleo way , has been slammed by the public health association of australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . ` in my view , there 's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead , ' said professor heather __yeatman__ , president of the __phaa__ . the cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef evans , a long time advocate for the paleo diet , __baby-blogger__ charlotte carr and __naturopath__ helen __padarin__ . evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher pan macmillan , including titles family food and healthy every day , and carr , the wife of australian idol contestant wes carr , runs the popular bubba yum yum website . bubba yum yum : the paleo way was marketed as ` simple , delicious paleo recipes for new mothers , babies and toddlers ' by ` health crusaders ' carr , __padarin__ and evans , who ` have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families ' wellbeing ' . the greatest concern , especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications , lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula , which is made primarily from liver and bone broth , reported the australian women 's weekly . publisher pan macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of march 13 . evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in october last year claiming that the modern australian diet is behind the rise in autism . charlotte carr -lrb- left -rrb- , the wife of australian idol contestant wes carr -lrb- centre -rrb- , runs the popular bubba yum yum website and is a co-author of the book . the broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of vitamin a for infants , but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance . professor __yeatman__ said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet , which excludes dairy and grains , parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force ` unproven ' beliefs on them . evans , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . ` that 's the really troubling thing : the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding . if the wrong decision is made , they may be seriously affected , ' she said . further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes , which contradicts national health guidelines . federal health minister __sussan__ ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue , and publisher pan macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of march 13 . the federal department of health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention . ` the department of health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes , in particular the infant formula , and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter , ' the statement said . in july last year , the __dietitians__ association of australia -lrb- __daa__ -rrb- criticised the paleo diet , with the association 's chief executive officer claire __hewat__ labelling the paleo diet was ` potentially dangerous ' and evidence of its benefits ` just does n't stack up ' . the paleo diet requires people to cut out ` grains , __legumes__ , certain dairy products , __conventionally-raised__ meats , __non-organic__ produce , and genetically modified and processed foods ' , which ms __hewart__ says is not practical for many australians . a disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors ` in good faith ' the recipes will lead to a healthier life , ` relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences . ' pete evans , pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts luke hines -lrb- left -rrb- , and wes carr , wife of fellow co-author charlotte carr , has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher pan macmillan , including titles family food and healthy every day . despite this , the book has been described as ' a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health . ' evans , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet , and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the australian food industry . evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in october last year claiming that the modern australian diet is behind the rise in autism , taking aim at the heart foundation and the __dietitians__ association of australia -lrb- __daa__ -rrb- as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet . his fiery rant , which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his facebook page , challenged the idea of the heart foundation 's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the __daa__ - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet . pan macmillan has been contacted for comment .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  chris evert has given a vote of confidence to laura robson by insisting that the former british no 1 can still make the world 's top 10 when she finally gets back from injury . the american , among the all-time greats of the women 's game , reckons that robson can make up for lost time despite having been out for 14 months with a wrist injury that required surgery last april . evert offered her endorsement as current great british no 1 heather watson went out of the miami open second round on saturday , beaten 7-5 , 3-6 , 6-4 by world no 15 angelique kerber after creating enough chances to have won . heather watson makes her way off the court after crashing out of the miami open to angelique kerber . watson was beaten 7-5 , 3-6 , 6-4 by world no 15 kerber at __crandon__ park tennis centre on saturday . ` yes it has been a very long but laura is still young so she will be fine , ' said evert , speaking at the launch of her new chrissie by tail clothing line . ` if she was 27 or 28 there would be a problem but she has got plenty of time on her side , ' said the __18-time__ grand slam winner . ` i was very impressed with her at wimbledon in 2013 before the injury . i was thinking top 10 for sure and that can still be attainable . but she has got to get herself really fit for her return to the tour and that is going to be tough for laura . ' current british no 1 watson -lrb- left -rrb- shakes hands with kerber at the net after their second round match . laura robson has been backed to reach the top 10 upon her return from a 15-month injury lay-off . there are signs that robson may finally be ready for a return to action in time for may 's french open in paris , despite missing out on miami and taking her name off the entry list for next month 's wta tour event in bogota . when she does come back , however , it is likely to be at a __lower-profile__ event . meanwhile , her long-time friendly rival watson resumed at 5-7 down in her __rain-delayed__ contest with kerber , having missed a set point the previous afternoon before a deluge arrived . the final two sets proved to be as wildly undulating as the first one had been . the 22-year-old from guernsey , breathing down the neck of her career-high ranking of 38 , will know that this was a match she could have won against a player who has been as high as no 5 in the world but has suffered a disappointing year to date . watson plays a shot at the 2013 us open - she has been out injured after needing surgery on her wrist . former us tennis star chris evert has backed robson to return to her best and make it to the top 10 . with a little more composure she would have done , and an indication of how much it hinged on the more vital moments was that she ended up with more points than her more experienced opponent , with 113 to 111 . the games often came in blocks as two nervous combatants became confident and then fearful again , depending on the scoreboard . in relatively cool conditions for this event , watson went 2-0 up in the second , then 3-2 down , before reeling off the next four games . watson ` will be fine ' as she is very young , according to former world no 1 evert . kerber , a left-hander who has been to the wimbledon semi-finals , then surged to 5-1 as watson was broken immediately in the decider , losing one point through a __volleying__ error of astonishing simplicity . the anxious german looked tired -- ` she 's __knackered__ , heather ' cried out an english voice -- and watson duly got back on serve to 4-5 before four unforced errors sealed her fate . it could have been a different end to this segment of the season , and once her doubles is over she will be concentrating on the clay courts .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  those who would love to see the lesser spotted laura robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope __trumping__ expectation . having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week 's miami open , she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month 's wta tour event in bogota , and the new target for her return appears to be the french open in may . that suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again , having not played since the australian open in january last year . former british no 1 laura robson protects her wrist while out in london . nobody is more frustrated about this than robson herself , now 21 and without a world ranking . she would dearly love to be in miami now , but instead is back practising over in bradenton near tampa at the img academy . perhaps __encouragingly__ , she posted a picture of herself on twitter doing a full , __tendon-testing__ handstand . robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career , which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery . here this week her manager , max __eisenbud__ , issued a __positive-sounding__ update while preaching patience : `` i 'm happy with the way it 's been going and she 's been hitting the ball great in practice , '' he said . `` it 's a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week . it 's all about when she is ready to compete . we do n't want to put her in a situation where she ca n't play a full tournament . '' among __eisenbud__ 's other clients include maria sharapova , whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach . `` i learned a lot from the whole experience with maria , and that 's why i feel strongly about not rushing it . laura is still young with a lot of time ahead . '' sharapova seems to have won her battle , but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident . when she finally decided to go for surgery last april to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 us open champion juan martin del potro , who has had operations on both wrists . she used the same specialist at the mayo clinic in minnesota . ironically this has turned out to be the argentine 's own comeback event and on thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to __vasek__ __pospisil__ . the fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an __abortive__ return in january shows just how __infernally__ complex wrist injuries are for tennis players . he was just delighted to be back on court : `` it 's not 100 % free , but i felt even better than sydney tournament in january , '' he said . `` it 's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist . i feel better week by week , but it 's still very early to feel 100 % . `` mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm , looking forward for the future . i 'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon . i want to play tennis . it does n't matter how long it 's take me to be in the top again . '' being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves . an example of this is 2010 wimbledon finalist vera zvonareva , who was out for 17 months following the 2012 olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery . robson has sought the advice of 2009 us open champion juan martin del potro . del potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the miami open . since returning at the start of last year the talented russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still __languishes__ at 153 . she lost another first round here this week . so it could be hard for robson whenever she returns , although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker . that much was clear when , enjoying a rare spell free from injury , she became the first british player since jo __durie__ to reach the world 's top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19 . it might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return . when she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in nike after being dropped by adidas , and will be coached by colombian mauricio __hadad__ , a former guide of heather watson . the 22 year-old from guernsey plays world no 15 angelique kerber in the second round while andy murray will take on america 's donald young .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  fans of chelsea , blackburn and wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker franco di santo is currently one of the hottest properties in germany 's bundesliga with werder bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches . even more surprising is the argentine 's views on the respective merits of the two leagues . contrary to popular belief , the 25-year-old insists players in germany are made to train harder than their premier league counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the bundesliga . a few months ago , di santo 's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of english clubs in europe this season , it appears he may have a point . franco di santo is loving life in the bundesliga with werder bremen after stints with three english clubs . the argentine striker moved to england with chelsea but also played for blackburn and wigan . following chelsea 's exit against paris saint-germain , it is unlikely any premier league will be in the quarter-finals of the champions league , with manchester city and arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home . in contrast , bayern munich are safely through to the last eight with borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the bundesliga next week . their fourth representative schalke gave real madrid an almighty scare at the bernabeu before going out 5-4 on aggregate . ` when i came to germany , i thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league , ' admitted di santo , who signed for bremen on a __bosman__ free following wigan 's relegation in 2013 . ` but when i got here and felt the intensity , it was like `` wow '' . everything is fast just like in england but sometimes i feel there is more pressure here . in the english league , you have time to turn around and go against the defender face-to-face , but here it is always pressure , pressure , pressure . di santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league but he was surprised . di santo says that after a career as a young player in the premier league he finds the bundesliga as intense . ` the other thing that is different is the kind of training . here , we train __twice-a-day__ two or three times a week . it was hard for me coming from english football where you sometimes have two days free in a week . ` here it is impossible to do that . maybe you have one day off every two weeks . the philosophy is completely different . in england , they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game , to get it in great condition . here it is the opposite , you have to train more . ` sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training , training . when i was in england i would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes . here i feel good , so maybe for my body it is better to train ! ' the reputation of the premier league has taken a __nose-dive__ recently but di santo is not surprised our top clubs are n't able to dominate in the champions league and suggests there may be a snob value towards the bundesliga because of the dominance of bayern munich . the 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as bremen rise up the bundesliga table . ' i think germany and england have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing . the premier league has 10 years more experience in that , ' he says . ` on the pitch , the premier league is not better or quicker . ` of course , bayern munich is by far the best team in germany but it 's not because the other teams are s *** , it is just because they very strong . ` if bayern came into the premier league , they would finish __top-three__ for sure and they could win it , why not ? they have world cup winners and players like -lrb- arjen -rrb- robben , -lrb- robert -rrb- lewandowski and -lrb- franck -rrb- ribery . di santo , modestly for his league , believes bayern munich would be in the premier league 's top three . the big striker took on chelsea and their midfield giant nemanja matic in pre-season . bremen won 3-1 . ` just because some of the other teams in germany are n't big names , it does n't mean they 're not good . ` we played chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1 . ok , it was pre-season but chelsea put out a good team and it was n't like they were able to score 10 against us . ' di santo , a 6ft 4in centre forward , has packed a lot of experience into his short career . he left argentina for chile very young and at 17 signed for chelsea with a big reputation . it did n't quite happen for him at stamford bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons . ' i had to be realistic , i was competing against -lrb- didier -rrb- drogba , -lrb- nicolas -rrb- anelka , -lrb- andriy -rrb- shevchenko , -lrb- claudio -rrb- pizarro and -lrb- salomon -rrb- kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time , ' he admits . ` the most time i got was 45 minutes against aston villa when anelka got injured . ' the presence of didier drogba -lrb- left -rrb- , who is still di santo 's friend , made it difficult for him to get game time . di santo -lrb- right -rrb- says his loan to blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by sam allardyce . franco di santo has hailed his argentine international team-mate angel di maria as one of the top 10 players in the world . di maria has struggled in england , as di santo did , following a record # 59.7 million summer move to manchester united . but di santo insists : ` di maria did so well in the world cup for argentina , it was a shame he was injured for the final against germany otherwise the outcome might have been different , for sure . ` he is among the top 10 players in the world . his best position is on the wing , either right or left . he is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others . ` i 'd say -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo are on a different planet but after them , there are five or six of around the level -- sergio aguero , arjen robben , edinson cavani , zlatan ibrahimovic -- and di maria . ' he went on loan to blackburn . ' i played every single game for a half a season and did really well , but did n't score - that was my big problem . i decided to stay another six months but then the manager sam allardyce did n't play me any more . it was weird , from amazing to becoming very hard . but i did get a goal and assist in our local derby against burnley and they made a dvd of the match with my face on the cover ! ' ironically , it was roberto martinez -- now in charge of england 's sole europa league survivors everton -- who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for wigan on a permanent basis in 2010 . ` it was my personal decision to leave chelsea , i still had time on my contract but needed to play . roberto told me i was good enough to play for argentina , he gave me confidence . and he made me think about getting into the penalty area more . before then , i only wanted to score pretty goals , go past a lot of players . ` now i realise if it comes off my knee , it still counts as one goal and that has helped me . ' wigan won the fa cup -- di santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season , and martinez left for everton . he signed arouna kone , __antolin__ alcaraz , james mccarthy and joel robles -- but not di santo . ` there is no problem with that , it would have been difficult to sign so many players from wigan , ' says the player . blackburn fans mob di santo after he scored against burnley and it even earned him a space on a dvd cover . wigan lifted the fa cup at wembley before being relegated , although di santo did n't play a single minute . instead , the forward -- who won three caps for argentina during his time at the dw stadium -- went to bremen in northern germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens . his winning goal against freiburg last weekend lifted bremen up to eighth , just six points of a champions league berth . unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for saturday 's big match against bayern . he still keeps in touch with old chelsea pals like drogba and branislav ivanovic and friends from wigan like alcaraz and __maynor__ figueroa . he admits though that having not been ready for english football at 17 , he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the german league have helped him develop . wigan owner dave whelan gets a champagne shower from di santo , but they would soon part company . while di santo is enjoying the bundesliga , he says he fancies a shot at ` revenge ' in the premier league . ' i am happy here really , i know i am in a league that is very competitive , one of the best in the world , ' he said . ` in one way i am very happy here , i am doing well and playing in a very competitive league . but for the other side i would like to have my revenge in the english league , show what i can do with the experience i now have . it may depend on roberto martinez or other coaches what happens ! ` if i have to stay in germany , i am going to be happy , and for the other side , if i have to go to england , i will try to do my best to show i am better than last time . ' di santo still has friends in england from his time there and keeps contact with a few chelsea players . di santo faced top players in england but says germany 's lack of big names does n't make teams 's *** '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: franco di santo was not at his best with chelsea , blackburn or wigan . but now he has 12 goals in 18 games with werder bremen . di santo says the bundesliga clubs demand players to train harder . he says bayern munich would at least finish in premier league 's top three . didier drogba and branislav ivanovic are still in touch with the argentine . striker wants to come back to have ` revenge on the english league ' di santo backs angel di maria to come good for manchester united .

__vasilyev__ hailed wenger as ` one of the iconic coaches of modern football ' but the arsenal manager is not big on sentiment . he was wounded by the 3-1 defeat in the first leg and aware that
