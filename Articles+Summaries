INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  an unusual time-lapse video made by a washington , d.c. nonprofit fundraiser and his friends shows former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton aging from her teen years to the present . clinton , 67 , is the presumptive democratic white house front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections . that would make her the __second-oldest__ chief executive to move into the white house behind only ronald reagan , who took office 17 days before he turned 70 . scroll down for video . born in 1947 : hillary clinton , shown tuesday at the united nations , kept a grueling schedule as secretary of state but she would be the __second-oldest__ president ever __inagurated__ if she were to win in 2016 . junior class vice president : in this 1964 illinois high school yearbook photo , the future us first lady was likely 16 years old . when __then-senator__ clinton ran for president in 2008 , she was 61 . a 73-year-old reagan famously quipped in a 1984 debate against democrat walter __mondale__ , then 56 , that he would n't make age an issue in his re-election campaign . ' i will not exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience , ' he said during a memorable debate . the new video , from a trio calling themselves the ` calculating clinton ' project , shows mrs. clinton in 28 separate photos , each morphing into the next at __2-second__ intervals . one of the project 's creators told daily mail online that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer . ' i do n't think her age __disqualifies__ her from becoming president , but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s . ' he said , requesting anonymity because his job does n't involve partisan __politicking__ . ` our video is simply an exercise in branding . we have no money behind us , ' he added , calling the effort ` just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people . ' he said there will be more videos hitting the project 's youtube page if mrs. clinton takes the plunge and runs for president . there 's no indication most americans today believe age should be a __disqualifying__ factor for a presidential run . one poll even indicates clinton has hid hers well . a pew research center survey released a year ago found that ` the public tends to underestimate hillary clinton 's age , ' with 60 being the median guess . a whopping 53 per cent of young voters , those under age 30 , told pew 's pollsters that mrs. clinton was in her 50s . another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50 . age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on tuesday . twenties and beyond : clinton in 1969 at wellesley college -lrb- left -rrb- , in a 1975 portrait -lrb- center -rrb- and four years later in 1979 -lrb- right -rrb- , when she was 32 years old . white house years : __then-first__ lady clinton pictured -lrb- left to right -rrb- in 1993 , 1995 and 1997 . after a united nations session on women 's global progress where a south african diplomat introduced her to cheers as a ` future president , ' she faced a gauntlet of hungry reporters in an attempt to explain an email scandal that has brought her an undesirable form of public attention . mrs. clinton told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state . she also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted , none of them vetted by the state department for materials subject to the federal records act . that law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs . clinton , who has been an attorney , the first lady of arkansas and the united states , a u.s. senator and america 's top diplomat , is expected to make a decision on running for president -- or staying on the sidelines -- next month . in the public spotlight : clinton spent eight years as a us senator -lrb- left , in 2001 -rrb- , ultimately conceded a presidential primary race to barack obama in 2008 -lrb- center -rrb- , and led the state __deartment__ for four tumultuous years -lrb- right , in 2013 -rrb- . 1 . ronald reagan : 69 years , 349 days . 2 . william henry harrison : 68 years , 23 days . 3 . james buchanan : 65 years , 315 days . 4 . george h. w. bush : 64 years , 222 days . 5 . zachary taylor : 64 years , 100 days . 6 . dwight d. eisenhower : 62 years , 98 days . 7 . andrew jackson : 61 years , 354 days . 8 . john adams : 61 years , 125 days . 9 . gerald ford : 61 years , 26 days . 10 . harry s. truman : 60 years , 339 days . source : ` the presidents of the united states of america ' by frank __freidel__ and hugh __sidey__ . the grueling schedule of a white house run could take its toll no matter how fit mrs. clinton is , according to national journal columnist charlie cook . ` in secretary clinton 's last year at her post , particularly the last few months at the state department , the position clearly took a toll on her health ; she experienced an episode of fainting or passing out , and suffered a head injury , ' cook wrote last month . ` none of this necessarily is to argue against her running , but she would be undertaking something that , as she well knows , is considerably more physically demanding even than her previous position , and at an older age . ' however history unfolds , the new time-lapse video 's soundtrack seems to describe the inevitable outcome of the 2016 campaign just right . ` when the band stops playing , ' a soulful singer __intones__ on the video 's backing track , ` only one will be left dancing in the round ' -- or in this case , in the oval .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: video produced by nonprofit fundraiser and two friends shows former secretary of state 's changing looks through the years . hillary clinton would be 69 if she were to become president in january 2017 , making her the second oldest to be inaugurated and less than a year younger than ronald reagan when he took office . americans generally think she 's younger than her actual age , especially voters under age 30 -- most of whom say she 's in her 50s or 40s . ` calculating clinton ' project promises more videos if the former senator and first lady runs for the white house .
INFO:tensorflow:GENERATED SUMMARY: clinton , 67 , is the presumptive democratic white house front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to win in 2016 . clinton , 67 , is the presumptive democratic white house front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days before he turned 70 .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a medical student on trial for stabbing a georgetown law student to death has used a rare defense - claiming his girlfriend committed the murder , despite his initial confession . rahul gupta , 25 , is charged with second-degree murder after mark waugh , 23 , was found stabbed to death in gupta 's apartment in silver springs , virginia in 2013 . gupta initially confessed to the crime saying he did it because waugh was cheating with his girlfriend . but this week in court , gupta 's attorneys have claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend taylor gould , who had in fact killed waugh , reports the washington post . ` this was an act of violent , crazy rage , ' one his attorneys , jennifer page , told jurors , later adding , ` you bet she was capable . ' rahul gupta -lrb- right -rrb- , a medical student on trial for stabbing mark waugh , -lrb- left -rrb- a georgetown law student to death has used a rare defense - claiming his girlfriend committed the murder . but this week in court , gupta 's attorneys have claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend taylor gould , who had in fact killed waugh -lrb- both pictured -rrb- . gould who has not been charged with anything and is not on trial , testified last week , telling jurors that she 'd been too drunk on the night in question to remember what happened . ' i had no reason to hurt anyone , ' she said . gupta , his 23-year-old girlfriend , waugh and one other had spent the night celebrating gupta 's birthday . gould consumed at least six drinks , including red wine , a __whiskey-and-cranberry__ , an irish coffee , and a margarita . dark turn : the group spent a saturday night out celebrating gupta 's birthday . the first three later returned to the girlfriend 's apartment where they continued to drink shots . after drinking , gupta and waugh returned to gupta 's girlfriend 's apartment in silver springs at 1:30 am where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol . taylor gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember anything clearly . neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment , like people were moving furniture . shortly before 3:30 am sunday morning , police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend . when they arrived on the scene , police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked . police opened the locked door and gould approached the officers with blood on her and said : ' i do n't know what happened . can you tell me ? ' officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and gupta lying on the floor , covered in blood . they asked gupta if he was hurt but he said : ' i do n't think so ' . prosecutor patrick mays told the court that when asked what had happened , gupta told them : ` my girlfriend and my buddy were cheating . i walked in on my girlfriend and my buddy cheating . i killed my buddy . ' officers found waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead - he had been stabbed six times and slashed five times . his lung was punctured and his jugular vein cut . the prosecutor said : ` mr. waugh did not die immediately . ' ` he could have lived for several minutes before dying from loss of blood . ' mays told jurors that a palm print and fingerprint -- in waugh 's blood -- also implicate gupta . at police headquarters , gupta admitted that he made a mistake , but added : ` he tried to kill me , though ' . who to believe ? while gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling , the girlfriend told police she was woken up by gupta 's yelling . she says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding waugh and he told her to call police . above , a picture of waugh . defense ? while being questioned by police , gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that waugh tried to kill him . gupta 's attorneys argue the reason he was covered in blood was because he had been performing cpr on his friend . defense attorney philip armstrong told the court that gould , who is now a biomedical engineer in washington , had got blood on the red dress she was wearing and then changed her clothes before the police arrived . he asked gould why one of her contact lenses was found stuck to the back of waugh 's pants . waugh had graduated magna __cum__ laude from james madison university in may 2012 , and went on to spend the following year in __daegu__ , south korea teaching debate . waugh had started his first year of law school at georgetown , and was inducted into the phi beta kappa honors society . gupta had a similarly bright future . he earned his undergraduate degree from george washington university and was back at the school studying to become a doctor . he also earned a master 's degree in physiology from georgetown . fellow langley high __school-alumnus__ david barton spoke about both men in the breeze - james madison university 's student newspaper . he remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields , waugh in liberal arts and gupta with science and math . ` it 's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved , ' barton told the breeze . ` you think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place . you just hope that the situation could have __de-escalated__ ' .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  an unusual time-lapse video made by a washington , d.c. nonprofit fundraiser and his friends shows former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton aging from her teen years to the present . clinton , 67 , is the presumptive democratic white house front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections . that would make her the __second-oldest__ chief executive to move into the white house behind only ronald reagan , who took office 17 days before he turned 70 . scroll down for video . born in 1947 : hillary clinton , shown tuesday at the united nations , kept a grueling schedule as secretary of state but she would be the __second-oldest__ president ever __inagurated__ if she were to win in 2016 . junior class vice president : in this 1964 illinois high school yearbook photo , the future us first lady was likely 16 years old . when __then-senator__ clinton ran for president in 2008 , she was 61 . a 73-year-old reagan famously quipped in a 1984 debate against democrat walter __mondale__ , then 56 , that he would n't make age an issue in his re-election campaign . ' i will not exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience , ' he said during a memorable debate . the new video , from a trio calling themselves the ` calculating clinton ' project , shows mrs. clinton in 28 separate photos , each morphing into the next at __2-second__ intervals . one of the project 's creators told daily mail online that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer . ' i do n't think her age __disqualifies__ her from becoming president , but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s . ' he said , requesting anonymity because his job does n't involve partisan __politicking__ . ` our video is simply an exercise in branding . we have no money behind us , ' he added , calling the effort ` just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people . ' he said there will be more videos hitting the project 's youtube page if mrs. clinton takes the plunge and runs for president . there 's no indication most americans today believe age should be a __disqualifying__ factor for a presidential run . one poll even indicates clinton has hid hers well . a pew research center survey released a year ago found that ` the public tends to underestimate hillary clinton 's age , ' with 60 being the median guess . a whopping 53 per cent of young voters , those under age 30 , told pew 's pollsters that mrs. clinton was in her 50s . another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50 . age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on tuesday . twenties and beyond : clinton in 1969 at wellesley college -lrb- left -rrb- , in a 1975 portrait -lrb- center -rrb- and four years later in 1979 -lrb- right -rrb- , when she was 32 years old . white house years : __then-first__ lady clinton pictured -lrb- left to right -rrb- in 1993 , 1995 and 1997 . after a united nations session on women 's global progress where a south african diplomat introduced her to cheers as a ` future president , ' she faced a gauntlet of hungry reporters in an attempt to explain an email scandal that has brought her an undesirable form of public attention . mrs. clinton told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state . she also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted , none of them vetted by the state department for materials subject to the federal records act . that law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs . clinton , who has been an attorney , the first lady of arkansas and the united states , a u.s. senator and america 's top diplomat , is expected to make a decision on running for president -- or staying on the sidelines -- next month . in the public spotlight : clinton spent eight years as a us senator -lrb- left , in 2001 -rrb- , ultimately conceded a presidential primary race to barack obama in 2008 -lrb- center -rrb- , and led the state __deartment__ for four tumultuous years -lrb- right , in 2013 -rrb- . 1 . ronald reagan : 69 years , 349 days . 2 . william henry harrison : 68 years , 23 days . 3 . james buchanan : 65 years , 315 days . 4 . george h. w. bush : 64 years , 222 days . 5 . zachary taylor : 64 years , 100 days . 6 . dwight d. eisenhower : 62 years , 98 days . 7 . andrew jackson : 61 years , 354 days . 8 . john adams : 61 years , 125 days . 9 . gerald ford : 61 years , 26 days . 10 . harry s. truman : 60 years , 339 days . source : ` the presidents of the united states of america ' by frank __freidel__ and hugh __sidey__ . the grueling schedule of a white house run could take its toll no matter how fit mrs. clinton is , according to national journal columnist charlie cook . ` in secretary clinton 's last year at her post , particularly the last few months at the state department , the position clearly took a toll on her health ; she experienced an episode of fainting or passing out , and suffered a head injury , ' cook wrote last month . ` none of this necessarily is to argue against her running , but she would be undertaking something that , as she well knows , is considerably more physically demanding even than her previous position , and at an older age . ' however history unfolds , the new time-lapse video 's soundtrack seems to describe the inevitable outcome of the 2016 campaign just right . ` when the band stops playing , ' a soulful singer __intones__ on the video 's backing track , ` only one will be left dancing in the round ' -- or in this case , in the oval .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: video produced by nonprofit fundraiser and two friends shows former secretary of state 's changing looks through the years . hillary clinton would be 69 if she were to become president in january 2017 , making her the second oldest to be inaugurated and less than a year younger than ronald reagan when he took office . americans generally think she 's younger than her actual age , especially voters under age 30 -- most of whom say she 's in her 50s or 40s . ` calculating clinton ' project promises more videos if the former senator and first lady runs for the white house .

' slipped through the net : __germanwings__ co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ had suffered from depression and ` burnout ' which had held up his career . investigators enter __lubitz__ 's house on the outskirts of dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues . in a blunt admission , __carsten__ __spohr__ , the head of lufthansa , which owns the budget airline , admitted __lubitz__ had slipped through the safety net . ` the pilot had passed all his tests , all his medical exams , ' he said . ` he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions . ` we have at lufthansa , a reporting system where crew can report -- without being punished -- their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment . ` all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case . ' __lubitz__ passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by lufthansa , according to the telegraph . the airline said __lubitz__ trained at the lufthansa flight training school in bremen . an assessment required by germany 's civil aviation authority , the __dlr__ , plus standards imposed by lufthansa were needed before he was accepted . however , although the process includes __psychometric__ testing of the candidate 's ability to work under pressure and handle stress , they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely , the telegraph reported . lufthansa , like other airlines , does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots . investigation : french prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder . search : teams working in the difficult alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . debris from the jet , operated by lufthansa 's __germanwings__ budget airline , was found near __barcelonnette__ . new information about __lubitz__ 's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat , which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend . officers found ` evidence of mental illness ' but no suicide note , der spiegel reported . it is understood detectives have found significant material on __lubitz__ 's computer , which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions . he reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying . however , he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly . germany 's federal aviation office confirmed this morning that __lubitz__ had a medical condition noted in his pilot 's records which required him to have a regular examination . doctors giving pilots their regular medical checks assess their psychological __soundness__ at the same time , according to the uk 's civil aviation authority . this is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that -- once a year for __under-40s__ and every six months for those over that age . pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests , but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress , fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse . caa standards state : ` during assessment of the applicant 's history , the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health , which may include mood , sleep and alcohol use . ` the doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant . ' a caa spokesman said : ` there is a psychological element to the pilots ' medical assessments . it forms part of the medical examination which pilots have to undergo to get their medical certificate without which they ca n't fly .

' speaking in a full auditorium , walker said he would not be cowed by those who disagreed with him . ` they seek to intimidate , ' walker said . ` but we never lost focus . we did what we had to do , and that 's what 's needed in america today . ' overseas interaction : walker also called for a stronger u.s. foreign policy , calling ` radical islamic terrorism ' the greatest security threat facing the united states . walker made his appearance in new hampshire , a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country , a week after signing a so-called ` __right-to-work__ ' bill . walker has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause , making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago . protesters are seen outside his saturday event . the ` __right-to-work__ ' issue has been contentious in new hampshire . legislators have sponsored several bills to make union membership optional , but the legislation failed to clear both chambers and would have faced certain vetoes by democratic governors . in his speech , walker called for more state and local control over education , a position that distinguished him from bush , who has backed the controversial common core national standards . walker also called for a stronger u.s. foreign policy , calling ` radical islamic terrorism ' the greatest security threat facing the united states . walker was quoted by the milwaukee journal sentinel as saying ` we need a president who will do whatever it takes , whatever it takes . who understands we have an ally in israel and we should start acting like it . who understands that radical islamic terrorism is like a virus and if you do n't take it out entirely , it 's like a virus in your computer that will keep coming back . ' the republican governor also reportedly said at the event that he was wearing a $ 1 kohl 's sweater and also described a teenage job at mcdonald 's . walker , the journal sentinel reported , ` earned an enthusiastic response from the crowd in concord . ' walker also took aim at democratic president barack obama and polices he said measured success based on how many people were dependent on the government . ` we should measure success on just the opposite , on how many are not dependent on the government , ' walker said . maurice tandy , 81 , a resident of the nearby town of franklin , said walker 's message resonated with him . ` he wants to bring government closer to the people , back to the towns and cities . ' jennifer horn , the new hampshire republican party chairwoman , told the boston herald ` it was a great day for the republican party , no question about it . we had 400 grass-roots activists together , energized , excited . obviously , gov. walker was very well-received . ' __ex-new__ hampshire state senator and walker supporter jim luther told __wkow__ ` he just comes across as a very straightforward guy and i think he has a very unique voice to speak to the center . ' the television station reported that the majority of people present have n't picked a gop primary candidate to back yet . time reported that walker also dismissed the the idea he 's a ` __flip-flopper__ ' on issues saturday , saying the term is ` just a narrative from the other campaigns that are frustrated with the fact that we 've got a strong reputation of keeping our word . ' according to the news outlet , walker did acknowledge changing his immigration views . competition : former florida governor jeb bush speaks with members of the media after visiting a packed house party on friday , march 13 , 2015 , in dover , new hampshire . meanwhile , bush said ' i have brought all my friends from outside of new hampshire to come do their part to enhance the economic climate of nashua . ' and when asked how he , as president , would confront islamic state militants , bush made a point of saying he was not yet a candidate for the office . ' i get really nervous about not triggering a campaign with all of these people around , ' bush said . each of the likely candidates is coached to couch their ambitions in __hypotheticals__ . walker 's ` not being a declared candidate ' caveat and bush 's ` i 'm considering the possibility of running ' statements are merely formalities at this point . several candidates are likely to start taking the next steps in april , and most have been laying the groundwork for a campaign for months if not years . for instance , walker was __tardy__ for a state party training session saturday morning because he was held up in private meetings with those he hopes will back his campaign in waiting . on his dance card on this trip : former gov. john h. __sununu__ , former sen. scott brown , manchester mayor ted __gatsas__ , state senate president chuck morse and county party chairs . ` there are so many people hoping to get a few minutes with the governor , ' new hampshire republican party chairwoman jennifer horn told waiting activists on saturday . when he eventually arrived to a warm reception , horn introduced him : ` we 're so grateful he 's made time for us .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a crystal with a ` forbidden symmetry ' that was once thought to be impossible to form naturally has been found . the so-called __quasicrystal__ was discovered in a 4.5 __billion-year-old__ meteorite in a remote region of northeastern russia . and studying it could help scientists find out how mysterious materials like this formed in the universe . scientists at princeton university , new jersey studied an ancient meteorite -lrb- shown -rrb- and found a __quasicrystal__ with a structure that it was once dubbed ` impossible ' . it was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature because the crystal has a symmetry in which atoms should n't form . the discovery was made by a team from princeton university , and is the second natural __quasicrystal__ ever found - both in this meteorite . prior to the team finding the first natural __quasicrystal__ in 2009 , researchers thought that the structures were too fragile and __energetically__ unstable to be formed by natural processes . ` the finding of a second naturally occurring __quasicrystal__ confirms that these materials can form in nature and are stable over cosmic time scales , ' said dr paul __steinhardt__ from princeton university . on the outside , __quasicrystals__ are solid minerals that look like quite normal , but it is their inner structure that __fascinates__ scientists . instead of the regularly repeating clusters of atoms seen in most crystals , __quasicrystals__ contain a more subtle and intricate atomic arrangement involving two or more repeating clusters . as a result , a __quasicrystal__ 's atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals , such as the shape of a __20-sided__ __icosahedron__ with the symmetry of a soccer ball . the difference between crystals and __quasicrystals__ can be __visualized__ by imagining a tiled floor : tiles that are __six-sided__ __hexagons__ can fit neatly against each other to cover the entire floor . but __five-sided__ __pentagons__ or __10-sided__ __decagons__ laid next to each will result in gaps between tiles . the team published the findings in the journal scientific reports . dr __steinhardt__ said the discovery raises the possibility that other types of __quasicrystals__ can be formed in nature . __quasicrystals__ are very hard , have low friction , and do n't conduct heat very well - making them good candidates for applications such as protective coatings on items ranging from airplanes to __non-stick__ __cookware__ . the newly discovered __quasicrystal__ , which is yet to be named , has a structure that resembles flat __10-sided__ disks stacked in a column . this type of structure is impossible in ordinary crystals , in which atoms are packed closely together in a repeated and orderly fashion , earning it the ` forbidden symmetry ' moniker . ` the structure is saying ' '' i am not a crystal , but on the other hand , i am not random either , ''' dr __steinhardt__ said . crystals with these ` forbidden __symmetries__ ' had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr __steinhardt__ and his team reported the first natural __quasicrystal__ , now known as __icosahedrite__ , in a rock that had been collected years before in __chukotka__ , russia . on the left , the top panel shows the symmetry of the first natural __quasicrystal__ called __icosahedrite__ . the lower panel shows the symmetry of the recently discovered __quasicrystal__ , which has not yet been named . right is the ordered yet __non-standard__ pattern of the __quasicrystal__ revealed by an electron beam . crystals with these ` forbidden __symmetries__ ' had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr __steinhardt__ and his team reported the first natural __quasicrystal__ , now known as __icosahedrite__ , in a rock that had been collected years before in __chukotka__ , russia -lrb- shown -rrb- . the researchers confirmed that the __quasicrystal__ originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about __4.57__ billion years ago - around the time our solar system formed . they published those results in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in 2012 . ` bringing back the material and showing that it was of natural origins was an important scientific barrier to overcome , ' dr __steinhardt__ said . this new __quasicrystal__ was found in a different grain of the same meteorite and has __10-fold__ , or __decagonal__ , symmetry . it is made up of aluminum , nickel and iron , which normally are not found together in the same mineral because aluminum binds quickly to oxygen , blocking attachment to nickel and iron . the researchers confirmed that the __quasicrystal__ originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about __4.57__ billion years ago , which is around the time our solar system formed -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- . the researchers are now exploring how the mineral formed . ` we know there was a meteor impact , and that the temperature was around 1,000 to 1,200 degrees kelvin , and that the pressure was a hundred thousand times greater than atmospheric pressure , but that is not enough to tell us all the details , ' said dr __steinhardt__ . ` we 'd like to know whether the formation of __quasicrystals__ is rare or is fairly frequent , how it occurs , and whether it could happen in other solar systems . ` what we find out could answer basic questions about the materials found in our universe .
